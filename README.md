###Projection Keystoner

A simple projection keystoner to help in complex projection setups (especially into corners with one projector)

####Why 3 video slots?
in order to easily project with one projector into a 2 or 3 point corner was the idea, but i'm sure you can figure out more uses!

####Instructions
1. Start Renderer
2. Load in videos (they will be paused on load)
3. Drag around corners until desired distortion is acomplished
4. Choose a video using the selector then engage/disengage properties
5. Press Start Videos

'Reset' returns all videos back to original positions and aspects.

'Clear' empties all  3 video slots.

Press escape key to engage fullscreen mode.

Videos will load stopped, you must press the 'start videos' to play them.
