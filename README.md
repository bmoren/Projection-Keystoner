###Projection Keystoner

A simple projection keystoner to help in complex projection setups (especially into corners with one projector)

####Usage:

+ Drag and drop videos into the dropzones, or load up using the 'read' button
+ manipulate!
	+ with the mouse onscreen or with values in the interface

####params
+ upper,lower,left,right
	+ manipulate corners with values
+ interp
	+ interpolate video?
+ aspect ratio
	+ preserve aspect ratio?
+ draw corners
	+ render the corners to the screen to drag around
+ enable mouse
	+ use the mouse to manipulate the corners?
+ reset
	+ erase everything for that video

####Why 3 video slots?
in order to easily project with one projector into a 2 or 3 point corner was the idea, but i'm sure you can figure out more uses!
